# [Pie Chart Creator](https://xtrp.github.io/Pie-Chart-Creator/)

Web app to enter percentages and get a downloadable colored pie chart!

This web app was built really fast and only really meant for personal use on a design project. It is published as a GitHub repo as others have expressed interest in having access to it as well. Note that a lot of this code isn't my best work, and much of it was written very fast and not for specific use in production.
